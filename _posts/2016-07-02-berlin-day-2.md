Berlin Day 2

I woke fairly late on the morning of July 2 and decided to walk to a nearby café called 19 Grams that I had heard about nearby. I exited our hostel and walked across the Oberbaumbrucke Bridge near the Berlin wall toward the southwest.

I grabbed a cappuccino at 19 Grams, a small minimalist cafe (like so many of them are here), and then crossed the street to a bakery for a chocolate croissant. Then I headed back across the bridge toward the hostel to see if the rest of the group was awake. 

Once everyone was on their feet we took the U-Bahn from Warshauer Strasse to Alexanderplatz, just under 2 miles to the northeast. We wanted to take the elevator of the Park Inn Radisson Hotel there to the top floor for a panoramic view. We paid four euros and jetted to the top of the tall building. At the top we were able to see a large amount of the city to the west.

After returning to the ground floor we set out southeast from the bustling Alexanderplatz toward Museuminsel, an island where many popular Berlin museums are located. After a short walk we arrived at the outside of the Berliner Dom (Berlin Cathedral)

We decided against paying the admission fee to enter and instead headed deeper into the Museuminsel through the Lustgarten.

After crossing another bridge to exit the island near the Neues Museum. On the other side was the German Historical Museum, a large two building compound connected by a subterranian tunnel. We paid €4.00 after presenting our student IDs and decended the stairs to the first exhibit, an exploration of structures and debris left in Eastern Europe following the Cold War. The dimly lit photographs of abandoned nuclear bunkers were particularly striking.

The exhibit on the floor above was an assortment of racist and xenophobic stickers, posters, and other material collected over the course of the last 200 years in Germany. The amount of items dated within the last 15 years was shocking.

From there we crossed underground to the permenant exhibit section. We climbed a wide, antique staircase to the first section that contained material from World War I and The Weimar Republic. From there we traveled back in time to exhibits on medieval German history and fast forwarded to World War II. There was an abundance of material on National Socialism there including propaganda posters, letters, and a huge anti-aircraft gun.

We then exited the museum and walked back across The Spree northwest to Hackescher Markt. There we picked up a couple beers at a small market and boarded the U-Bahn. From there we traveled to the western edge of the Tiergarten, the large city park in Berlin. I had in mind to try out a restaurant called Schleusenkrug on the bank of the Landwehr Canal. We sat in one of the many outdoor seating areas near the water amongst many eager fans of the German national football team. Germany was playing in the quarterfinals of the UEFA EURO tournament that evening. We ordered a large sampler plate filled with sausages, cheese, and salad, along with Weisswurst (a white sausage) and bretzel.

When we had finished eating and drinking we walked south along the western edge of the Tiergarten and passed the Berlin Zoo. Close by we boarded the U-Bahn and took it a ways back east to our hostel in Friedrichshain. 

After resting at the hostel for a bit we decided to go get a couple drinks and watch the first half of the game at a viewing party nearby. We walked down Warschauer Strasse to UrbanSpree, an outdoor bar and gallery that had a huge projection of the game set up. Nearby were many other outdoor bars built around a series of abandoned warehouses on Revaler Strasse. After enjoying the first half we were ready to head into Central Berlin for the main viewing party near the Brandenburg Gate. 

On the way to Warschauer Strasse Station we stopped by a Döner Kebab spot for a bite and then we were whisked away to the west on the U-Bahn. Once we had made it to our stop, we had to walk along the eastern edge of the Tiergarten to the only entrance for the viewing party. By the time we made it in the game was tied in the 85th minute. 

Fortunately, no one scored and we were able to catch 30 more minutes of action. Yet after extra time the game was still tied and penalty kicks ensued. Finally, Germany was able to secure the victory and pass onto the semifinals to take on the winner of the Iceland-France match the following day.

On the return back to Friedrichshain we were accompanied by a chanting crowd of excited fans. Following the quick ride back to Warschauer Strasse we took off to the east to see what else was going on that night. There we found a lot of unique bars, including Frenc, a craft beer and crêpe joint. However, lacking energy we decided to head back for the night around 1:00.
