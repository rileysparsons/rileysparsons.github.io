#Frankfurt

We landed in Frankfurt, Germany last night around 9:00 pm local time following a seamless connection in Istanbul. After gathering our bags we finally figured out which train to take into the main station of the city (Frankfurt Hbf), although it shouldn't have been too difficult at all. After two quick stops and a 10 minute train ride, we were in the massive train station at the center of Frankfurt. 

Eventually we were able to navigate through a sequence of strip clubs and crowds watching Poland take on Portugal in the UEFA Euro Cup at outdoor cafes and find our hostel for the night. We stayed two minutes away from the station which was convenient but admittedly not the most charming section of the city. 

After dropping off our bags in our room on the 4th floor, we headed back to Frankfurt Hbf to buy our tickets to Berlin the following morning. We found an automated kiosk in the station and began the purchasing process when the machine "aborted" the transaction swallowing our Euros that we had just withdrawn from a nearby ATM and failed to return any ticket or reciept. After inquiring about how we could get our money back, we were told we would have to wait until 6:00 am the following morning when the ticket office opened. 

Fast forward six hours and we were back in Frankfurt Hbf, ready to grab our cash and head northeast to Berlin. Unfortunately, the office was not able to refund us the lost cash on the spot and said they would deposit it directly into one of our bank accounts. With that, we decided to purchase our tickets to Berlin from one of the representatives at the office, and head to Berlin on the 7:02 train.

#Berlin

We got into Berlin at 11:00 am this morning. It's a partially cloudy, warm 80 degree day. At Berlin Hbf (the main station) we were able to link up with Andy's friend Maria (originally from Portugal, but now going to school in Germany) and do a brief walkthrough of the city before checking into our hostel. Right out of the station we headed across the Spree and to the Reichstag, the German parliament building. Then, after a short walk we were at the Brandenburg Gate. After snapping a quick photo, we purchased a day pass for the public transit system and headed away from the tourist sites for some cheaper and higher quality food. 

After several short train rides we found La Foccaceria somewhere near Zionkirschplatz in Mitte. Soon after eating a massive amount of pizza, we opted to head to our hostel, Plus Berlin, and relieve ourselves of our 40 pound packs. Plus is located just east of a remaining portion of the Berlin Wall on the Spree. It's a great location and we hit another stroke of luck and got an upgrade to a private room for our three nights in Berlin.
