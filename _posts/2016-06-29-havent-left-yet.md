# A Bit of a Delay

Due to the bombing outside the international terminal at Atat√ºrk Airport in Istanbul, we opted to delay our flight until June 29. We'll be connecting through Istanbul still, but staying well within the airport security checkpoints. 

Fortunately we were able to stay in San Francisco with a friend last night and are now headed to the airport to check-in for our 6:10 pm PST departure.
