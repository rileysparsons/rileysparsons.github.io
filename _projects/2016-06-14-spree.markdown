*[Download](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/spree-student-marketplace/id965705751?mt=8) Spree on the Apple App Store.*

#Summary
Spree was founded by myself and [Marco Ciccone](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mciccone10) in late 2014 in order to enable students to sell secondhand items like textbooks and furniture to other students, using their smartphones. 

By March 2015, I had developed a rough prototype native iOS application that allowed users to login with their school email addresses, post items, and communicate with each other. 

In May 2015 we won the grand prize at Santa Clara University's First Annual Business Pitch Competition.

In late May 2015 we debuted the first release of Spree for iOS on the Apple App Store.

#Development Process
In December 2014, I began researching how I might build an app that would allow users to post an item to Spree, and browse for items to purchase, and contact each other when needed. Parse was selected as the backend for the app because I had worked with it previously while developing SceneScope, and it was a fastest way to get the app up and running.

The initial version of Spree contained a tab bar with three different views: "All", "Categories", and "More". Posts could be created while browsing in the All tab within a primitive view that prompted users to fill in information on what they were selling. The fields included "Title", "Price", "Description", with other fields like "Class" when posting a textbook for sale. Also, users were able to include up to three photos of the item they were selling by selecting the "Add Photo" buttons on the bottom of their screen.

In the next major iteration of the app, a "Messages" tab was added to the tab bar to allow users to contact each other within the app. Previously, the users were forced to contact each other outside of the app interface, leading to a clumsy, less sticky experience.
